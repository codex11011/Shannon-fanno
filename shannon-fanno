# Shannon-fanno
Shannon fanno is a lossless data compression algorithm . This is an implementation of shannon-fanno on c

The input is in the form of a string and output is table showing shannon-fanno encoding of each unique word in the 
input string. 'frequency.c' is calculating the frequency of each word in the input string and storing all the frequencies 
in an array. Probability of each unique word is calculated by dividing the frequency of a particular word by the sum total 
of all frequencies. 'shannon-fanno()' produces the encoding.
